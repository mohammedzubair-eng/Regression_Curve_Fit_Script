# Step 1: Define the power law model
# Step 2: Input your actual data (X-Y values)
# Step 3: Filter out near-zero X values (since power law is undefined at 0)
# Step 4: Fit the curve
# Step 5: Predict Y values up to X=30
# Step 6: Plot the data and the curve
# Step 7: Print predicted value at X = 30
